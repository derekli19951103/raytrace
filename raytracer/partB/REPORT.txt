=======================================================

Overall Submission
We completed the mandatory requirements and implemented 
five features for part B: Anti-aliasing, Depth of field,
Extended light sources, Environment mapping and Glossy
reflection.  

Instruction of running code:


=======================================================

Code, and the file structure of the submission
raytracer.cpp:
contain anti-aliasing, depth of field, 

main.cpp:

scene_object.cpp: 
Glossy sphere model, 

...

=======================================================

Part A
Done by Derek
a)

b)

c)

d)


1. scene signature

2. a rendered scene with only the diffuse and ambient 
	components of the Phong model
 
3. a rendered scene with all three terms of the Phong 
	model

=======================================================

Part B
Yufeng:
- Second reflection

- Hard Shadow

- Environment Texture:

- Soft Shadow



-------------------------

Yining:
- Anti-aliasing (16X supersampling) 
	By casting 16 rays to each pixel, each ray is shifted
	by 0.25 pixel, and render the pixel by the average 
	of the rays.

	Result images: antialiasing*.bmp 

- Depth of field
	By casting multiple rays to every pixel, with randomize
	eye position, adjustable focal distance and aperture. 
	In part B, we set the focal distance close to the jade
	plane, everything else is a bit out of focus, depends 
	on the distance.

- Glossy reflection
	We change the ray by giving it a new random direction 
	within a range in sphere model, so that the ray of reflection
	will be in different direction for each pixel. The roughness
	is depends on the value "roughness". 
	The pictures we showed in folder is relatively "rough" since
	there is only one ray being used for the final result. The 
	glossy effect will be better if using more ray.
